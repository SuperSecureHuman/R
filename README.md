# R Basics

Will extend if I get time

These 4 folders are basics for R.

[01 - Starting with R](./01%20-%20Starting%20with%20R/)
[02 - Vectors and Sorting](./02%20-%20Vectors,%20Sorting/)
[03 - Playing with data](./03%20-%20Playing%20With%20Data/)
[04 - Scripting and progamming with R](./04.%20Scripting,%20Programming%20with%20R/)

I'll add new folders for each
