# Setting up R Arch Linux (BTW)

To use R on VsCode, you need:
    VSCode (duh?)
    
    R (Install from Pacman repo)
    
    R Extention for VS code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.r)
    
    R debugger (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RDebugger.r-debugger)
    
    R Tools - optional - (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Mikhail-Arkhipov.r)

Note: To run R Tools, you need dotnet 5.0. This is available on the AUR, and it will work just fine


Using R Studio for R is recommneded, because of its IDE features.

You can use rstudio-desktop-bin from aur for this.

I will be using DataSpell By Jetbrains for this. I like this IDE, even though it eats ram :sweat_smile:


You have to install dslabs package - install.packages("dslabs") - To ensure repatablity of the code.
